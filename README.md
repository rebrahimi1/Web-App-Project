# Web-App-Project
This web application is created and developed for students to check which computer science courses are being offered at GSU. Students can check the schedule and instructor of each cours. They can also add/drop courses to their semester schedule.
There is a To do list for students as well, to track their daily/weekly/monthly tasks and responsibilities related to school. In order to register for courses, students need to create an account and login. 

# Course Recommendation System is also part of the web app functionality. Students can choose their career interest and the system will recommend CS courses that they need to take.
